	 * @class UndoBuffer
	 * @brief A fixed-depth undo stack that serializes commands into a contiguous byte buffer.
	 *
	 * @details Rather than storing polymorphic command objects, each undo step is appended as a
	 *          @c CommandHeader (type + payload size) immediately followed by a POD payload
	 *          (e.g. @c UndoTransformData). @c commandOffsets records where each command begins,
	 *          allowing the most recent command to be located and replayed. This keeps undo data
	 *          cache-friendly and free of per-command heap allocations. The history is capped at
	 *          @c maxUndoSteps; pushing beyond the cap evicts the oldest command.
	 *
	 * @see CommandDispatcher, generated_undo_commands.hpp
